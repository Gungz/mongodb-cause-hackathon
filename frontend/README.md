# Front End

This is the Front End for administrator to configure the settings of what to be extracted per document type using prompt.

## Prerequisite
Built using `NodeJS 20.17.0` and `create-react-app`

## How To Run
In the project directory: 
1. Open`.env` and change `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` to where you deploy the backend solution.
2. Run `npm i` and then `npm start`

## In Case of Issues
If you try to run locally and face issues, try the following:
1. Initiate new project using `npx create-react-app <project-name>`.
2. Copy the files from this project to the new project.
3. Run `npm i` and then `npm start`

## What's Next
1. Fix responsiveness issue of the navigation bar.
2. Add authentication.
3. Add more validation (e.g. not allowing user to continue if the output of prompt is not in JSON, etc.).
4. Add infrastructure as a code to deploy this on AWS.

## Other Available Scripts from Create React App
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
